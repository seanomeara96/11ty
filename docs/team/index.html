          I can highly recommend DC Physiotherapy in Clondalkin Village. I
          experienced lower back pain over the last 3-4 months as a result of
          working from home and it was starting to take its toll. I heard about
          DC Physiotherapy from friends and I am delighted I made an appointment
          to see David as within 5 mins, he was able to provide a root cause for
          the pain. Three sessions later and I am back running pain free. Thanks
          David for your guidance and genuine interest in my well being.

          I have had a painful herniated disc in my neck for over 12 years .The
          pain travelled throughout my shoulders arms and hands.I experienced
          sleepless night's from time to time.When I heard about IDD therapy I
          decided to give it a try. After a few visit's I found a good
          improvement and was soon painfree.The improvement continued throughout
          my treatment.I am now free from pain and painkillers. I would
          definitely recommend anybody with physical issues to go for IDD
          therapy. I am glad I did and its safe and painless.James.

          About two years ago I injured my lower back which caused restricted
          movement and a lot of sciatica pain in my left leg. I tried ignoring
          it, hoping it would get better over time. surprisingly it didn't. I
          went for a scan and the the consultant said my only option was an
          operation to remove the section of herniated disc that was applying
          pressure onto the sciatica nerve. To be honest the taught of an
          operation scared me. So I decided to try alternative treatment first.
          I tried Physiotherapy, with no success. Then I tried amatsu treatment,
          still no success.
