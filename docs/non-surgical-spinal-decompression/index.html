            Typically, someone suffering from disc issue was usually given pain
            meds, instructed to stop all physical activities, referred for
            physiotherapy, and when they weren’t progressing they were sent for
            spinal surgery. Conservative Physiotherapy proved very helpful in
            many cases, yet there have been some cases when surgery seemed to be
            the only other option… until now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thankfully, you don’t have to live with pain from disc issues
            anymore. Thanks to the research of a team of top physicians and
            medical engineers, Non-Surgical Spinal Decompression Therapy was
            developed to effectively treat lower back pain, neck pain and
            sciatica resulting from herniated or degenerated discs. Non-Surgical
            Spinal Decompression Therapy not only significantly reduces back
            pain in many people, but also enables the majority of clients to
            return to more activities they enjoy.

            Data from a recent multi-center pilot study utilizing Axiom
            Worldwide’s DRX9000 Reveals a Dramatic Success Rate of 88.9%!
          </p>
          <p>
            The clinical results of an IRB-approved prospective, multi-center,
            phase II, non-randomized pilot study utilizing the DRX9000 was
            presented at the annual New York State Society of Anesthesiologists
            PGA meeting in New York City December 7-11, 2007. The study,
            authored by Dr. John Leslie of The Mayo Clinic, was designed to
            evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the DRX9000 in the
            treatment of chronic lower back pain. Patients enrolled in the study
            had suffered an overall average of ten years of chronic back pain.
            After two weeks of treatments on the DRX9000 there was a 50%
            reduction in pain scores and upon completion of the entire six week
            protocol an amazing success rate of 88.9% was documented.

          <summary><h3>how does spinal decompression work?</h3></summary>
          <p>
            Non-Surgical Spinal Decompression uses new cutting edge, state of
            the art technology to apply a distraction force to relieve disc and
            nerve compression often associated with low back pain, neck pain and
            sciatica.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spinal Decompression, not to be confused with simple traction,
            gradually lengthens and decompresses the spinal discs, creating
            negative pressures within the centre of the discs. This reversal of
            pressure creates an intradiscal vacuum that helps to reposition
            bulging discs and pull extruded disc material back into the disc,
            taking pressure off pinched nerves resulting in pain relief. Spinal
            experts believe that nutrients, oxygen, and fluids are also pulled
            into the disc to create a revitalized environment conducive to
            healing.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary><h3>what are the treatments like</h3></summary>
          <p>
            At the start of each treatment, you will be fitted with a harness
            designed to achieve optimal decompression of the low back or neck.
            During a treatment of non-surgical spinal decompression you will
            notice a gentle lengthening of your spine as your discs are
            gradually decompressed and relieved of pressure. The treatment
            process is safe and effective. While some patients with extensively
            injured discs have reported mild discomfort during the first few
            treatment sessions, their discomfort subsides upon subsequent
            visits. A patient safety switch provides an extra safety feature,
            allowing you to stop at any point should you feel discomfort. Each
            treatment session lasts approximately 30 minutes. Individual patient
            results may vary.

            <h3>
              why is spinal decompression different from traction, physical
              therapy and chiropractic manipulation
            </h3>
          </summary>
          <p>
            While traction, physical therapy, and manipulation may reduce disc
            pressures to as low as 40 mm Hg, only spinal decompression has been
            shown to achieve negative pressures within the spine. It has been
            clinically proven that spinal decompression creates negative
            pressures as low as -110 mm Hg3 within the injured disc during the
            treatment session. Normally, pulls exerted on the spine trigger
            sensory receptors in the back to tighten the muscles surrounding the
            vertebrae and discs in an effort to protect them from injury. Spinal
            Decompression bypasses this response by slowly pulling on the spine
            and relaxing the back over an extended period of time, allowing the
            discs to be repositioned without tension and without causing spasm
            and muscle guarding.

            I can highly recommend DC Physiotherapy in Clondalkin Village. I
            experienced lower back pain over the last 3-4 months as a result of
            working from home and it was starting to take its toll. I heard
            about DC Physiotherapy from friends and I am delighted I made an
            appointment to see David as within 5 mins, he was able to provide a
            root cause for the pain. Three sessions later and I am back running
            pain free. Thanks David for your guidance and genuine interest in my
            well being.

            I have had a painful herniated disc in my neck for over 12 years
            .The pain travelled throughout my shoulders arms and hands.I
            experienced sleepless night's from time to time.When I heard about
            IDD therapy I decided to give it a try. After a few visit's I found
            a good improvement and was soon painfree.The improvement continued
            throughout my treatment.I am now free from pain and painkillers. I
            would definitely recommend anybody with physical issues to go for
            IDD therapy. I am glad I did and its safe and painless.James.

            About two years ago I injured my lower back which caused restricted
            movement and a lot of sciatica pain in my left leg. I tried ignoring
            it, hoping it would get better over time. surprisingly it didn't. I
            went for a scan and the the consultant said my only option was an
            operation to remove the section of herniated disc that was applying
            pressure onto the sciatica nerve. To be honest the taught of an
            operation scared me. So I decided to try alternative treatment
            first. I tried Physiotherapy, with no success. Then I tried amatsu
            treatment, still no success.
