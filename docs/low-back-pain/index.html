        <h2 class="headline">Your Lower Back</h2>
        <p>
          There are five vertebrae present in the lower back or ‘lumbar spine,’
          with cartilage discs in between to buffer them. The protective cage
          that covers the spinal cord is formed from the vertebrae. The sacrum
          sees the end of your lumbar spine, that portion that rams into your
          pelvis. The stability of your spine depends on the ligaments and
          muscles of the back and the abdomen. There is increasing evident to
          suggest core stability is vital in the rehabilitation of low back
          pain.

        <h2 class="headline">Conventional sources of Lower Back Pain</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>Back Muscle Strains</summary>
          A back muscle strain can happen for many reasons. Carrying weighty
          objects; wrong lifting postures and muscle burnout can result in poor
          joint stability and injury. Leaning from the waist instead of the
          knees to pick heavy objects is one of the most common precursors of
          backaches.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Ligament Sprains</summary>
          A ligament sprain occurs when the ligament fibres are torn. Ligaments
          are solid fibrous bands and are very tough; however, if they are
          strained much further than they can bear, they get torn. The aftermath
          of this is swelling and severe pain, which is the after effect of a
          car accident or some other vicious trauma.
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Poor Posture</summary>
          <p>
            Drooping while in a sitting position or standing and lifting things
            stresses your spine. Muscles weakness, ligaments strains, and discs
            stretch can cause your spinal joints and nerves to be under intense
            pressure.
          </p>
          <p>

            problem, treatment may include tackled and remodelled any lifestyle
            or habits that are precursors to your back pain. Two primal physical
            components that everyone hinges on to maintain a healthy lower back:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>A back that is fluid and moves freely!</li>
            <li>
              A well-conditioned back that sees the core musculature absorbing
              the bulk of the load being heaped on the back instead of the
              structures that make up your spines such as the discs and
              intervertebral joints.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Adherence to Physiotherapy rehabilitation is vital in your recovery.
            The possibilities of reoccurring pain is high if you don’t complete
            your rehabilitation program, disobeying the rules in building up
            core abdominal strength and sustaining mobility is often held
            culpable for re-occurring back pain!
          </p>
          <p>
            Physiotherapy rehabilitation should be completed a few times in a
            week. A program will be created by your physiotherapist that you can
            comfortably do at home; it’s Imperative that you adhere strictly to
            these as it builds up energy and flexibility to help guard against
            another injury.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the proper lower back pain exercises and special treatment, and
            of course a guide from your physiotherapist, you can finally arrive
            at that point where you’re free from pain.
