          <p>
            Disc Degeneration, Disc bulge, Slipped Disc, Disc Prolapse or
            Sciatica are conditions that present with back pain and/or trapped
            nerves. Disc desiccation is quite a prevalent condition and is often
            cited as one of the main causes of lower back pain complaints.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Intervertebral disc or more commonly called spinal disc is
            located between two adjacent vertebral bodies. There are five discs
            in the lumbar spine, the first being located between L1/L2 (lumbar
            vertebra 1&2) and the last one is located between L5/S1 (Lumbar
            vertebra 5 and Sacrum)
          </p>

    <div class="wrapper">
      <div class="generic-content">
        <h2 class="headline headline--normal">The Disc</h2>
        <p>
          The disc consists of two separate parts. The outer part consists of a
          series of bands or rings called annulus fibrosus. These bands resemble
          sliced onion and their behavior can be described as a telephone
          directory rolled into a tube shape (very strong under compression).
          The central portion of a disc is called the nucleus pulposus and acts
          like a jelly substance that has a lot of fluid. Its behavior resembles
          a spongy ball. Because every vertebra has a distinct shape in the
          thoracic, lumbar, and cervical spine, the function and structure of
          the disc also vary.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the lumbar spine region, the main purpose of the intervertebral
          disc is to absorb shock and control compressive loads. It is important
          to mention here that the disc in any other part of the spine is not
          subjected to the same degree of compression because of the vertebral
          shape. What this means is that a disc issue in the lumbar spine is
          very different from a disc issue in the neck.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="generic-content">
        <h2 class="headline headline--normal">Biomechanics</h2>
        <p>
          When the intervertebral disc is subjected to compressive load the
          central portion (nucleus pulposus) tries to expand sideways but is
          restrained by the rings of the annulus fibrosus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The annulus is an elastic structure but more rigid than the nucleus
          and it resists the pressure to deform - much like the metal rings on a
          wooden beer keg.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pressure in the disc varies according to the position of the spine
          and how long the position is maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people find it surprising that the disc is placed under
          significant pressure when sitting - a daily occurrence for many. This
          can be a little surprising because sitting doesn't feel like a lot of
          effort to sit but it does place continuous compression upon the disc.
          That's also why it's a good idea to get up, move around & change
          positions regularly even if your job does not require it.

          Forward Bending (Spinal Flexion)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Bending forwards causes the front section of the disc to be compressed
          while the back portion gets stretched.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this motion is conducted in a repetitive manner such as in jobs
          that involve bending or hobbies like gardening, this can cause damages
          to the annulus fibrosus fibers and can lead to degenerative disc
          disease.

        <h2 class="headline headline--normal">
          Forward Bending / Twist (Spinal Flexion)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Forward bending or twisting is a very common motion that many of us
          throughout our lives. However, anyone with back pain issues will
          attest that this position is the culprit behind acute and sharp lower
          back pain and chronic back pain sufferers try their best to avoid this
          position. Workspace safety training advice avoiding bending the spine
          and instead of using legs to compensate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, despite several years and decades of rigorous training,
          the prevalence of pain injuries in the workplace has not been reduced.
          Under normal conditions, our pelvis, hips, and spine are designed in
          such a way that they can withstand the pressure of twisting and
          bending.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the back gives out suddenly, it usually means there has been an
          underlying joint change (which is often ignored) and usually stays
          under the radar. This change alters muscle control and joint
          mechanics, hence predisposing the pain to injury. The most common
          underlying factors include poor muscle control i-e spine stiffness,
          hips and pelvis, trunk and/or hip joints muscle control.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diagram below illustrates all the stages of change that occur
          within the disc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something important to note here is the fact that the first two stages
          are considered, for the most part, to be non-painful and rarely
          generate any symptoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mostly the result from repeated low-grade trauma which, in most cases,
          doesn’t generate any conscious awareness or inflammation. The inner
          part of the disc doesn’t have any nerve supply therefore it can’t
          generate any pain sensation. It is when the condition worsens over
          time, symptoms are usually felt.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="generic-content">
        <h2 class="headline headline--normal">Symptoms of Disc Degeneration</h2>
        <p>
          Sciatica (nerve pain in the legs) is the most widely reported and
          recognized symptom of disc-related issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some sciatica patients might also have back pain but most of the cases
          are centered around leg pain. If the disc bulges but doesn’t compress
          any nerves, it might cause pain in the back region (primarily around
          the hip and buttocks section) and not down the leg.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the disc itself is painful, it can produce a sensation of pain
          described as “deep” pain and it is not very easy to locate through the
          surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          This pain can either be very sharp (might be referred to as nerve
          pain) or it can be a more generalized aching sensation that produces
          discomfort. A disc that is just irritated but hasn’t prolapsed through
          the annulus fibrosus region might feel very vulnerable similar to any
          other sprained structure like ankle or knee ligament.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Too much pressure” in the back region is another sensation often
          reported and patients often need to lie down to ease the sensation.
        </p>

          Degenerative Disc Disease Treatment
        </h2>

        <p>
          Physiotherapy treatment options depend on the severity and stage of
          the condition. The first and foremost priority should be unloading the
          disc using support strapping, muscle activation, corrective exercises,
          or in some cases Lumbar corset. One thing important to note here is
          that every effort should be made to avoid disc bulges progressing to a
          full hernia which requires surgical intervention. This is one of the
          main issues faced using different techniques to “put the disc back”
        </p>

        <p>
          If the disc has shown some signs of recovery (which might take some
          days to several weeks), the next step in the rehabilitation process
          should be increasing movement, ensuring food postural muscular
          function, and increasing load tolerance with very carefully crafted
          and executed exercise sequences.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the most crucial part of the rehabilitation process and if it
          is not executed properly, it can easily cause a relapse.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your Physiotherapist will prescribe exercise, this will be precisely
          selected, executed, and monitored.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the final phase of the Physiotherapy rehabilitation process, all
          the normal daily living tasks need to be comfortable, the more
          advanced and challenging tasks related to your lifestyle should be
          incorporated into the physiotherapy rehabilitation program gradually.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your hobby is gardening, the physiotherapy rehabilitation program
          should focus on ensuring that your spine is fully capable of bending
          and tolerating that sustained position
        </p>

        <p>
          In some cases, this type of advanced flexibility might be problematic.
          For such cases, alternative ergonomic adaptations are required to
          facilitate the activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the motive behind physiotherapist rehabilitation is to return to
          sporting activities such as tennis or golf, the advanced stages of
          rehab need to analyze the components that are involved in these
          activities, testing each one of these components in a controlled
          setting under proper supervision and then increasing the load to
          replicate the particular sport-specific activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Doing so requires your sports physiotherapy rehab process to involve a
          combination of specific manual therapies directed at the joints,
          coordinating the muscles, specific corrective exercise with some forms
          of simulated activity in a rehabilitation gym to prepare for
          activities of daily life.
        </p>

        <p>
          To sum it up, physiotherapy involves identifying and treating the
          painful structure and then addressing and treating the causative
          factors. Causative factors might be a combination of extrinsic factors
          (such as tools, workstation, time, position, breaks, etc) and
          intrinsic factors (mechanics of the body). All these elements need to
          be carefully assessed and treated by a qualified physiotherapist.
