                  Last month, I developed an injury while playing football and
                  decided to go see a physio as I was not able to do simple
                  daily tasks of my own. Fortunately, a friend recommended
                  physiotherapy Clondalkin and I'm so grateful to him for that
                  now. My body has fully recovered after only a few sessions.
                  Good Job guys!

                  I had a neck problem with a disc protruding giving me huge
                  discomfort. My Doctor said there was nothing they could do but
                  surgery, which may not work. I researched myself and found DC
                  physiotherapy. Dave was amazing he talked me through the
                  procedure and after a number of sessions, I was back in the
                  gym and playing basketball again. A totally amazing result.
                  Dave was so knowledgeable and I have never looked back. Had
                  one or two maintenance session since, but all is perfect now.
                  Could not recommend him highly enough.

                  After trying other physios and every drug under the sun, I
                  searched for an alternative treatment for the severe pain my
                  herniated discs were causing me. After a 30 min consultation
                  with Robbie, I felt assured that he knew what he was talking
                  about. We started a 10 session course of spinal decompression.
                  The treatment itself was very comfortable, and I loved that it
                  was treating the issue, rather than the symptoms. I started
                  right after a 3 week long back spasm where I couldn't stand up
                  or put my shoes on without help, and I am now pain free. I
                  want to thank Robbie, Kane, and David for their help and
                  welcoming environment throughout my course of treatment, and I
                  would recommend this to anyone.

          I can highly recommend DC Physiotherapy in Clondalkin Village. I
          experienced lower back pain over the last 3-4 months as a result of
          working from home and it was starting to take its toll. I heard about
          DC Physiotherapy from friends and I am delighted I made an appointment
          to see David as within 5 mins, he was able to provide a root cause for
          the pain. Three sessions later and I am back running pain free. Thanks
          David for your guidance and genuine interest in my well being.

          I have had a painful herniated disc in my neck for over 12 years .The
          pain travelled throughout my shoulders arms and hands.I experienced
          sleepless night's from time to time.When I heard about IDD therapy I
          decided to give it a try. After a few visit's I found a good
          improvement and was soon painfree.The improvement continued throughout
          my treatment.I am now free from pain and painkillers. I would
          definitely recommend anybody with physical issues to go for IDD
          therapy. I am glad I did and its safe and painless.James.

          About two years ago I injured my lower back which caused restricted
          movement and a lot of sciatica pain in my left leg. I tried ignoring
          it, hoping it would get better over time. surprisingly it didn't. I
          went for a scan and the the consultant said my only option was an
          operation to remove the section of herniated disc that was applying
          pressure onto the sciatica nerve. To be honest the taught of an
          operation scared me. So I decided to try alternative treatment first.
          I tried Physiotherapy, with no success. Then I tried amatsu treatment,
          still no success.
