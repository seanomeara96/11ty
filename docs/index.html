            Last month, I developed an injury while playing football and decided
            to go see a physio as I was not able to do simple daily tasks of my
            own. Fortunately, a friend recommended physiotherapy Clondalkin and
            I'm so grateful to him for that now. My body has fully recovered
            after only a few sessions. Good Job guys!

            I had a neck problem with a disc protruding giving me huge
            discomfort. My Doctor said there was nothing they could do but
            surgery, which may not work. I researched myself and found DC
            physiotherapy. Dave was amazing he talked me through the procedure
            and after a number of sessions, I was back in the gym and playing
            basketball again. A totally amazing result. Dave was so
            knowledgeable and I have never looked back. Had one or two
            maintenance session since, but all is perfect now. Could not
            recommend him highly enough.

            After trying other physios and every drug under the sun, I searched
            for an alternative treatment for the severe pain my herniated discs
            were causing me. After a 30 min consultation with Robbie, I felt
            assured that he knew what he was talking about. We started a 10
            session course of spinal decompression. The treatment itself was
            very comfortable, and I loved that it was treating the issue, rather
            than the symptoms. I started right after a 3 week long back spasm
            where I couldn't stand up or put my shoes on without help, and I am
            now pain free. I want to thank Robbie, Kane, and David for their
            help and welcoming environment throughout my course of treatment,
            and I would recommend this to anyone.

                Neck pain can be a result of increased pressure on a spinal
                disc. Muscle strain or muscle spasm are common causes of neck
                pain.
