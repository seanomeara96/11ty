            Last month, I developed an injury while playing football and decided
            to go see a physio as I was not able to do simple daily tasks of my
            own. Fortunately, a friend recommended physiotherapy Clondalkin and
            I'm so grateful to him for that now. My body has fully recovered
            after only a few sessions. Good Job guys!

            I had a neck problem with a disc protruding giving me huge
            discomfort. My Doctor said there was nothing they could do but
            surgery, which may not work. I researched myself and found DC
            physiotherapy. Dave was amazing he talked me through the procedure
            and after a number of sessions, I was back in the gym and playing
            basketball again. A totally amazing result. Dave was so
            knowledgeable and I have never looked back. Had one or two
            maintenance session since, but all is perfect now. Could not
            recommend him highly enough.

            After trying other physios and every drug under the sun, I searched
            for an alternative treatment for the severe pain my herniated discs
            were causing me. After a 30 min consultation with Robbie, I felt
            assured that he knew what he was talking about. We started a 10
            session course of spinal decompression. The treatment itself was
            very comfortable, and I loved that it was treating the issue, rather
            than the symptoms. I started right after a 3 week long back spasm
            where I couldn't stand up or put my shoes on without help, and I am
            now pain free. I want to thank Robbie, Kane, and David for their
            help and welcoming environment throughout my course of treatment,
            and I would recommend this to anyone.

          I can highly recommend DC Physiotherapy in Clondalkin Village. I
          experienced lower back pain over the last 3-4 months as a result of
          working from home and it was starting to take its toll. I heard about
          DC Physiotherapy from friends and I am delighted I made an appointment
          to see David as within 5 mins, he was able to provide a root cause for
          the pain. Three sessions later and I am back running pain free. Thanks
          David for your guidance and genuine interest in my well being.

          I have had a painful herniated disc in my neck for over 12 years .The
          pain travelled throughout my shoulders arms and hands.I experienced
          sleepless night's from time to time.When I heard about IDD therapy I
          decided to give it a try. After a few visit's I found a good
          improvement and was soon painfree.The improvement continued throughout
          my treatment.I am now free from pain and painkillers. I would
          definitely recommend anybody with physical issues to go for IDD
          therapy. I am glad I did and its safe and painless.James.

          About two years ago I injured my lower back which caused restricted
          movement and a lot of sciatica pain in my left leg. I tried ignoring
          it, hoping it would get better over time. surprisingly it didn't. I
          went for a scan and the the consultant said my only option was an
          operation to remove the section of herniated disc that was applying
          pressure onto the sciatica nerve. To be honest the taught of an
          operation scared me. So I decided to try alternative treatment first.
          I tried Physiotherapy, with no success. Then I tried amatsu treatment,
          still no success.
