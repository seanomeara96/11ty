          <p>
            Often pains and aches are defined during the term Arthritis. In
            reality, there are various types and forms of arthritis. Most common
            forms of arthritis include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis or
            common “wear and tear”, degenerative arthritis, infective and
            juvenile arthritis. Each type of arthritis differs in symptoms and
            requires different treatment.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just like any other disease, there is a severity scale with two
            polar extremes as well as varying points that lie between. After
            determining the severity of the disease a proper treatment plan can
            be formed. Where do you lie on this scale? This is crucial in
            determining the treatment plan as well as the subsequent outcome
            (also called prognosis).

        <p>
          Osteoarthritis/degenerative arthritis is the most common type of
          arthritis. It is also known as a degenerative joint disease (DJD). It
          is important to mention here that osteoarthritis has a very large
          spectrum of severity and progression. In its milder form, the patient
          might just feel some pain while doing an activity but if the disease
          has progressed substantially, a complete joint replacement might be
          required.

        <summary>How Physiotherapy Can Help In Treating Arthritis</summary>

        <p>
          Many patients can get comprehensive help in treating and managing
          their arthritis by utilizing physiotherapy techniques involving
          stretching, mobilization, muscle strengthening, and postural training.
          Physiotherapy techniques aim to reduce the symptoms of arthritis by
          reducing pain and improving functionality whereas arthritis itself
          remains in its current form.
        </p>

        <p>
          An effective physiotherapy regiment involves evaluating each case by
          using relevant examination as well as treatment procedures to
          determine the best course of action. Getting a diagnosis of arthritis
          doesn’t mean “start of the end” as many generally think. Although it
          is generally thought that there is no “cure” for arthritis, it can be
          effectively managed by determining the stage and progression of the
          disease.
        </p>
      </details>

        <summary>Arthritis – Treatment</summary>
        <p>
          In the very initial stages of arthritis, pain is usually present in
          the soft tissue that surrounds the joint and this can be treated very
          effectively using physiotherapy. If the pain is left untreated, it can
          cause the joint to stiffen up which in turn restricts joint mobility
          and a very vicious cycle of repeated tissue irritation begins due to
          these flexibility deficits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some secondary effects on muscle functionality such as muscle becoming
          inhibited or getting switched off are also caused by arthritis
          progression. The role of a competent physiotherapist is to identify
          these secondary elements and implement a correction program to resolve
          these issues.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Arthritis – Surgery</summary>
        <p>
          When the pain originates from any joint surface, this can be a cause
          of serious concern. In few cases, treating soft tissues helps unload
          the joint surfaces and can ease the pain. However, if the surface
          becomes rough, broken off, or worn away this will require either
          “clean up” or an exploratory surgery also called arthroscopy or in
          most serious cases, a joint replacement.
